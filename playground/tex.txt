uh as well as this is a panel discussion so I'm here to bounce ideas and see uh very
inductive the hardest answer with regard to
Industry 5.0 is no we have not discussed industry 5.0 as a concept like how we
have done the industry 4. but that being said The Core Concepts of
Industry 5.0 which was presented previously with resilient sustainability
and humans in Greek are very much part of scania's future plan and also today's work I
would say there are two ways to look at it maybe we haven't thought about industry 5.0 as
a concept or it's there already in in digitalization things that we do
and we haven't put a name to it we just worked with it but the other question that you asked for me about the
technology roadmap that I can talk about quite extensively if you want so we have
a tool you can call it a whole technology roadmap so we have this tool which is an
extensive list of different technologies that we would require for the future and I mean future really
long term looking like 20 40 is the year that we set for ourselves
um and try to build scenarios on where the world would be in in 15 20 years
in each of these different scenarios what is that Scania would require in
terms of Technology competence when I mean competence both hard competence as well as
self-confidence and how do we develop ourselves towards
that goal and that we work with quite extensively so this technology roadmap that I'm describing it definitely
includes quite a lot of sustainability uh
tools and methods and and Technologies as well and
definitely a lot on human-centric like how do we help humans so the whole point
is competence development so we of course think about our employees The Operators and technicians in addition to
engineers and managers as well so how do we as a group develop competences
towards these future um scenarios that we could end up with
so we use this on all of the production units at Scania for competencies
so that is how we work with uh today towards future


yeah thank you very much yes okay and I have several questions but maybe I can
just let the audience or other panels can speak do you have any comments or other questions about his answer
anyone in this lower yeah
do you think that it would make any change if you start thinking of that's
personally for me keeping away from buzzwords and
sorry to say industry 5.0 no no I didn't decide anything no it's okay but it's
good
how we could benefit the industries that from that perspective of course it's really good but when it comes to a
application and implication in the industry it's more case like Casey specifically so that is why it really
doesn't matter but of course the the pillars that you presented these these resilience and
sustainability and circularity and human-centric focus that's of course our Vital and what we have to focus
I have a one question so you mentioned that it is like a tool it's a
technological roadmap so it makes sense that you are very oriented to the tool and maybe the value comes after but do
you think it's maybe not about only in Scania but do you think it is it possible to change this concept to the
into some business like a value first and a tool later comes later
work on the two so there could be new additions to
the tool there could be things that will delete it because it's obsolete anymore so it's it's a living tool so it's like
okay so the tools could get in and get out on a yearly basis so you revise it every
year not
level structure for it we have themes and domains and then the technology areas
okay yeah so we work on all levels okay yeah
yep thank you for your answer oh yes I oh okay I will
and like maybe they really work in conjunction how do you work equine conjunction like the technology roadmap
with the sustainability roadmap because I know you work so much with waste and
reducing energy waste
um we have road maps for everything it's a
big company we have road maps for accessibility we have a roadmap for Quality we
have how I would put it sorry you said something more
uh Sandra did you say something more I would say the technology roadmap is
what we use for confidence development purposes the others could be more
ah it's it's submitted
[Music] quality and and whatnot so we have a lot
of road maps but I would I would say like this the technology roadmap that we have is
more from the point of view of confidence development
so this is more comprehensive than individual roadmaps that's sustainability or digitization or
quality building so this would be like including everything
um and and this will sort of represent the whole organization that rather than
a specific groups within a production unit which is just quality or just it's
so this would be the more comprehensive view on things so this this technology roadmap that I'm talking about includes
for example technology areas like energy use biocentric production
the answer for your question Sandra
small comment from my end I I think
clear cut between between four and Industry five is maybe a bit theoretical because in reality it
is I think this is an endless Evolution that is ongoing actually a lot of
companies are still struggling to read some type of values from industry foreign and all the good things that
comes in the concept of Industry five is is to me a more an evolution of the
industry for uh and it's it's a very ill-fit type of evolution into more
environmental and um change or resilience and the user
oriented views I think it's good to package it and
instify but maybe in a few years this time we would talk about industry 10 and it's it becomes a bit blurry I think the
key theme on what's going on right now is really the green industrial transition and that will take all the
Technologies over of a plant productivity into something that are of
a greater good and that's where you find in District Five just a reflection
most of the companies I'm working with are still struggling with getting the basics or industry forward in place
foreign [Music]
struggling and working hard on that I definitely agree with the perspectives
that industry 4.0 suggests but it's definitely more challenging
than but I also think one more thing it's not like clear steps like you achieve
something and move on to the next we are still doing industry 3.0 things we are still working with computers and
internet which was pretty much Paradigm Shift one before industry for
myself so it's like everything coexists it's not completely moving from one to the next it's like neighbors the every
new edition is enabling the way
yeah I totally agree with you because maybe if you think about like a whole planet maybe some part of the world
maybe it's different like some some country they're more advanced than some country they are not Advanced so the
technological level should be we are like in living together with those things I think
uh yes and I think I can just stand here so I hope everyone can hear me and I
think it's a good uh discussion uh like a perspective from the Scania but maybe
we can move on to more like a general uh perspective so I have a question to you
oof uh because you have you are not like a working with some like a specific
client but maybe you are more working with the general perspective so my question to you is the what was the like
what do you think about the The crucial elements to have a successful digital
transition maybe from your based on your experiences what was the key element to
make this trendy fan happen [Music]
is 55.
four and five because again most companies are the touching upon the concept of a file
and I think um there are a lot of challenges of course if you go back
if you go back in time Swedish industry is very Advanced we and
it's driven by the hard and very high salaries in the region so to make the
industry competitive we have been working with automation a lot since
that's I think you call that industry three and that means that it's been a
massive investment in factories moving into an automation Technologies and and the Legacy and and you have all these
hands-all knowledge that's put into the technology however today most of the
people that actually build this Foundation to make the Swedish industry effective or actually not there anymore
they are retired so we sit thing with an advanced industry that now need to switch and
that are Po and partially switching to the industry poor and eventually the
industry five and I think this situation opens up a
lot of challenges because minor companies are sitting in this Advanced setup which is good from
Theory a few years back to perspective but it's also a bit of a struggle
because in the future they need to be connected all these islands of operations need to be
connected you know that already but that's super difficult to break these
silos in the industry and to invest and to modernize and I think this is this is
the struggle that a lot of companies are doing right now
oh sorry oh sorry can you can you accept me or someone
else or now I think it's fine right yes
okay very good yeah so so the industry has a lot of challenge with the Legacy
that's the point and then then moving into four you need to open this up you
need to extract the data you need to start integrated and you need to work with the security and there are so many
risks so many companies that are super afraid of opening up the the production
sites from a security perspective specifically now when we are faced with
service security threats around the world so so it's a quite a big step just
to move into four and now um but there are some that has been
successfully done that already and there are some that actually taken the leap step to five but most likely those are
companies that are pushing for Green Field implementation that are setting up new plans in general which is really
fantastic North world and and even companies like ssab is Now setting up
new companies up in the north I mean it's it's a big thing that is moving on driven by the green industrial
transition but again just to summarize uh to your question the key enablers and the and
the problems I think it's it's security is clearly one of the challenges that
need to be overcome but you also given this is an um ecosystem play you need to involve
all the stakeholders in a different way not just the owners um it's it's a multiple stakeholders across
company they need to be involved to make this happen and to create that common Vision on on what is the value for the
people in the plant or the companies all the partners I think that's the thing that we need to
work on there's a risk I will continue forever otherwise
no no it's fine yeah thank you for your answer and maybe I can let also give
some space for here or someone from online do you have any question or
comment yet Sandra
people are not there and the trends in in in the scientific Community is to
describe the operators working in these systems as smart and Escape
and this is really wrong uh and that's a real like challenge like
how can we successfully help the companies in like finding people like
still a good work where they can be Innovative and creative and like
connecting with the new technologies although they are not as smart or
skilled anymore maybe as smart is like the wrong word but as skin
like do you have a tip for how to help companies in doing that










well I I can only share what's going on from Iron then and
what's going on from from a system technology implementation company like April
um first I agree with you I mean we we see we see these big change from a people perspective from from blue color
to actually Factory become effective white colors and it's it's a different skill sets of
people in the industry in the in the factory in itself the or this simplest
type a traditional Factor work or or not there simply in the previous time there are somewhere there of course today but
maybe in a few years time we will only have like Advanced High University to
develop people in the factory I mean that's a possible scenario who knows
yeah we maybe we we don't really know but yeah but the thing is it's it's uh
it's gonna be a different stuff or people in the future factories they're going to have different demands
uh and how do you how do you get these people enthusiastic about working in
such a factories you need to provide them with with tools that you need to provide them within an environment or
that they really like you need to work close to the to the workers and make
sure their the environment are safe and really nice I mean focus on the people
and the factory will be critical and so for example the way that the company like Viper is reacting on this trend is
that we're buying design companies and we're working closely with with them with customers in in shop floor design
on how to interact in a different way to make that operations much nicer
and more secure so I think that's the short answer and
then I can of course continue on double clicking and what that means but it's really that key thing that I see is
happening getting closer to them to the worker that are becoming different
and create new solutions for those workers does that make sense to you
yes I would of course like to know more like how do you get closer to the worker
and how do you do the design but I know already like the other perspective is
that many people are now hiring like from from Manpower and other consultancy
firms just to be able to do their assembly work and that's another type of
you I mean still the shop floor needs to be attractive and nice but it's like
any type of people that is working there
yeah it's interesting Evolution isn't it um maybe I can interrupt you uh because
we already talked we already started to talk about human-centric so I think it's a good time to ask you Sandra so I
prepare a question to you about like a human-centric design so as you are working in rice maybe you have a lot of
research project especially for the human-centric perspective so how do you
like incorporate in terms of the human-centric perspective into your project maybe you can introduce your
experience and the knowledge in that perspective to us
yes thank you of of course I don't have like all the right answers and
we work with different types of models like uh working with the cognitive
models or socio-technical models and how to think about how users should
collaborate with machines and how that should be implemented into the
organization since many are working with lean Concepts already there's like
trying to connect the already used language and bridging that with with
like focusing on the human and I think one main thing is to really
work in a multi-disciplinary way so like connecting models of chronic
cognition with technology used and data security for instance
there's a lot of things that we need to develop further indeed so maybe the keyword is not focused on
just focus on the maybe some specific Technologies more about like a multi-disciplinary perspective we can
bring something from psychology or ux other design perspective as well yeah
thank you very much and the environmentals yes
um do you have any comments or question to her
I feel this problem is not necessarily just with operators but this issue is on
all levels in Industry exactly even when we talk about digital tools it's like yes it's one thing to have
them in place but for it to work for the people to use it
then it's about the people maybe we lose the human-centric approach there when we
design things when we Implement a new technology or a new
Solutions is it the same could I agree or assume that this is not just an operator that
of course operators are more important because they are the ones who does most of the work in the factory but it's it's
cascading effect to all first
[Music]
civilization further like many successful companies have
stated that you need it needs to be leader driven so the leaders need to
really understand what is going on and be able to like
give the resources so that the technology can indeed be user-centric
which means that they have to understand it like all of the people need to understand it
like smart and connected like we saw in one of the nice figures that Jake
presented earlier it's not the hierarchical level but it's all of them
connected yes
do you see also in in were you working
um a trend increased Trend or using like mixed reality type of concepts for um
users on the shop floor Etc any thoughts on that
yes I'm involved in a project where we work with VR for instance and
like before and like we tried to investigate how it can be like applied
or implemented in a successful way and we are very curious but
like you said earlier like the the it means that the personal competence
levels are shifted and sometimes we don't know how to do that in the most efficient way so we do some use cases
and we try it but we don't really understand how or
in many cases it fails like we don't really see the
success right away at least not in the bigger companies but sometimes also in the smaller
companies so we we don't have the possibility of doing that if we say like solo but and we
implement the 3D like instructions straight away based on like the investment of millions
I don't know then we can see some other technology shift happening because we really like
invest and like try to make it successful or implemented
straight away the answers some things
interesting yup thank you Sandra maybe then we can
move on to the bigger companies what are they doing so I can ask asanian so maybe
in zenika you are adopting a lot of Technologies and new like teams in terms
of like digitalization do you how do you adopt new technology when it comes to like you need to introduce some new
teams to The Operators or not only for The Operators some like a way of working
we we had some a lot of these kind of discussions that we're having now in effect internally within us
we started with by creating an organization to to
start like deploying digital uh in in a
widering perspective but still we are struggling
with with the questions that everyone is talking about right now we we had some
kind of collaboration with other other companies
where we try to we ran a program where we set people from management and Technical experts
together with the people working with lean and other questions that is more human-centric
ways of working and have this kind of program where
we wanted to emphasize the digital culture so we wanted to start with what
are the needs and we want to help people to understand like what's digital before
starting with implementing different Technologies but we still have this kind
of focus on the technology itself itself if we think of like we we do see that
digital twins is a very good technology that you could use to to be more
efficient for it for instance so we could start with instead of going to the problem itself and seeing like what are
the operators or the managers on the shop floor struggling with daily and how could we
help them with the solution we go and start with we have a digital twin technology how could we apply it from
this so so it's it's a bit of struggle even if we think of the digital culture and
try to focus on the problem itself the digital Solution on it we are not
there yet but I I would say that we're trying to do something to to be to
be able to solve this problem and we are also having some kind of boot camps in
the third part of the uh organization to be
to tell people about like this these are the technologies that are available how
could that help you and start like the projects from from
the shop floor and have this digital organization to help with running the projects and
so it feels like there are like a two ways you have a like a organization who
is in charge of this digital cultural introduce and then also problem-based
when you find the problem and you try to solve the problem with these two boxes
yeah something like that it's not that structured this way that we would like to have it it's more
like happening sometimes it's uh sometimes it's it's successful sometimes it's more pushing a technology that we
think it's right it's a good one yeah right sometimes
yeah and do you have any questions or comments
uh yeah Rami um I think I mean from from what I this
what everyone said and from the discussion can you hear me yes we can hear you okay
um it feels or in my opinion the the success of the vision in Industry zero
uh will be linked to how we can
um have use the the enabling Technologies in a way that would lead to sort of
gains in all the pillars human Centric sustainability and resiliency for
example uh I mean we would have the meta world so we would have XR technology
that is human-centric I mean uh
it's probably easier to to have competence development foreign to use this technology and
by using this technology we can link to other native technologies that would lead to sustainability or to recognize
like digital twins to to to optimize certain uh
operations and then we have enabled technology and networks and everything together and my feeling is
that that it would be a win-win-win use case as well that that will sort of
promote the success of Industry part of zero uh I I think this is like more of the
recipe also when it comes to sustainability so I think the focus on use cases where
there's this win-win-win uh will be will be uh promoting or will
be sort of motivating giving incentives to company to implement such a
a way of working with that or tasks that are human-centric
unsustainable I think I think this is my sort of perspective on this
yeah thank you for your input I think when we are thinking about like when we are in elementary school I think it was
easy to learn something from the case so maybe it's also same to the organization like if they can start from the case or
some concept that they can understand easily maybe that's easier to adopt it
yes and yeah we have another perspective from Anna
so you have a lot of experience in the industry and maybe for example for the
Volvo CE as well so can you give us some input when you are implementing new
technologies into your work or maybe in your current work you can introduce some new things as well
yeah I I thank you very much and I a very interesting panel discussion and I
agree with with a lot of things uh so forth maybe I I tend to repeat what this
already said in my own words uh I I first of all it was really good to see the definition and customization of
industry for that zero because it's not very well used uh uh yet so it's coming
from a more theoretical work and the theoretical side
um and I as you said I also have to base this from my previous position then research and uh the main things that I
see in the latest year is really to bring this concept of value into the discussion and also the integration of











sustainable development goals and their awareness of it that has been really a shift uh and and to start with
addressing the question what problems are we trying to solve with the technology and then we can discuss how
to do it and it will really differ I mean if it's all the engineering based such as I mean example Energy Efficiency
for the glacier systems or steering system of the production system and in general then it's probably other
stakeholders involved but if you compared to integrating tools like you mentioned uh mixed reality like
argumented reality for example for for having a concurrent Engineering Process uh with r d in order to improve assembly
for example the operating Staley environment then it's another type of of uh approach that you have to take so
engaging the social technical uh really requires an awareness awareness of this
when you put up a strategy so it's also aligned with the production system that you have your legacy that it was into
and that also requires skill management and understanding how this how to manage
this from the human and the soft factors uh it also you mentioned the the skills
of the operator and and also the manager skills I think it's also requires
adequate skills from the data scientist that is really hard to find and recruit
nowadays but it also requires skills from the ones that is ordering the
decision makers uh and that requires more like CRS from
uh Innovation management or knowledgement management and perhaps also strategies and theories so I I
think this to conclude is this is why it's also important to work with you from Academia uh not only on the
technology but also Bridging the knowledge and understanding the integration on these different levels
mentioned from The Operators to the middle manage but also breaking the the existing silos
in large companies uh and to add on a complexity also in their faces with the
different actors that are going to to support the transition in the value chain
so uh to conclude this type of discussions initiatives to
find the platforms where we can discuss this type of question is or management
Knowledge Management and Innovation management disease really important as
well in order to take some makeups forward
yep thank you Anna uh I have a just quick question you mentioned about it's really difficult to adapt and introduce
new technology into the larger companies and I remember you started to work with
the small and medium companies in your region do you think it will be easier to work with a small and medium companies
or we need another like a different approaches to the smaller medium companies
I I've uh
but I also Define what you mean with it's because
it's coming from the University side with a very high knowledge and then we
have the very oh sorry Anna
can you hear our connection is was not good so maybe can you I mean
yes I will mute here maybe
can you yes now we can hear your word can you
repeat your answer sorry for that great foreign
company [Music]
I think it's a very good start is to start to Define what time
means what if I
thought Monday so
foreign
but I'm sure you recognize this as well yeah thank you for your answer uh wolf
do you have any comments no I I think I think that's a really
good comment actually because this whole shift industry for industry five and uh horse tracks it's
[Music] maybe this is
all required
industry in this country is based on a lot of sport I think that's a
that's these companies Direction
okay I think okay um
yes
planning to come into latex but for example science based Target and circularity uh those two concepts will
will really bring challenges when we look into what supply chain is needed in order to to achieve the Paris agreement
and what the efficiency do they need to do in order to to Really fulfill what
the larger oems are requiring now
exactly and how do you how do you really convince these companies to move in
these directions I mean new regulations from European
Union is one thing but uh demand from their customers usually better at
driving force and how do you how do we really make these companies take a quicker step
in these directions to be more sustainable and circular that's because
that's very closely aligned with the industry profile I think this is
um the baby question really yep Sandra you have a yes
or a lot of a lot of your tips going on like previously one example is the robot
leave where 540 smaller medium-sized Enterprises went through kind of
Investigation what is needed and then they could apply for some funding from Triplex Market
and uh a lot of them made changes in their automation level and also the
competence levels but so there are a lot of other types of initiatives going on
but still not all of the companies know about it and also they don't have time
right and I would also like to latch on to
what Rami said about the success stories because there are quite a lot of success stories for industry 4.0
like uh describing maybe excellent tortilla Pia where where they did World
Tour where they did a lot of like efficiency adding but also increasing
the digitalization removing papers happier workers so on
but still sometimes and also after Maxon but we forget that the product of that
is years and years and years of development maybe into uh
digital culture or other types of Investments
so we will take some time and I think it's also a matter of how to like introduce or promote a successful story
to other companies as well that's also very important
that we need another type of series as well to understand how the Knowledge Management is is going is going to to
lead to this success and that's also where you from Academia is as a very good support and opinion
with this because we need conceptualization and we need some Hands-On practices in in combination
yeah thank you for your input yep
please yes yeah my comment was on this
other type of Industry that's growing rapidly in all over the world including Sweden is this exactly factories
we have a dirt of [Music] operators and technicians there right
now and it's only going to increase we need thousands if not more across several factories in in Sweden
so this problem is is already quite challenging and complex and it's only
increasing many Falls set aside and with this new battery
factories the the the tasks themselves are new we
have never produced batteries in large scale before and we've never worked with chemicals before yeah so it's not just
competences but also it's not just people but also what type of Competency do we need so it's
significantly bigger problem than yeah it was a few years ago I feel like this is when the the Tesla introduced like
the electrical cars I think it was like a big transition from the traditional automotive industry just like electrical
devices so I think that will be or not it will be happening in the battery production as well
do just from Scania itself we know that we have a new battery Factory it's not ready yet but soon it will be and we
know that we have several hundreds of operators we don't have yet so we're going to use operators
from other factories within Scania and make them work there how will it work we don't know we have to wait
yep I think we already use the before then uh we planned but I think it was
really good discussion for the in this topic so I would like to move on to the
next topic for now so we have a topic about the how to
collaborate between industry and Academia I think we already touched upon some of the points already the first
part so that we can keep discussing on this so there are several questions as
well but I would like to start a question to you uh Anna because maybe
you are the expertise or you have many experience experiences in this Academia
industry collaboration in terms of like how to build a good net bridge between
them so my question is yeah maybe you already mentioned about it what could be
the key success factor to make it happen or to make it successful
yeah I think we we start to be that we're all human and it as a starting
point and uh I think one of the key success factors is to basically understand
the first person working in Industry operate in two different contexts
uh and the key is to align those systems to get the most out of it
so I'll start with creating trust and I mean how do you create the trust and my
personal series is that you start to create trust by being yourself like
being authentic and transparent and open when having the dialogue or problems to
set up together and then you need to be transparent and how you need to to work together to
solve it you have to discuss that and also uh the key point for industry is
what results you expect in the end uh you have a strong driving force for the
Publications in the Academia is it's a very good to conceptualize and
and together uh knowledge uh production in that sense
but it's normally not what you expect as an industrial person in the end to get
the paper sent with a lot of conceptualized knowledge so it starts on
with discussing that and and be clear on what you can do and will you you will
not do as a researcher to not touch the the borders of of
consultancies or or be clear what what is expected from you from from the scientific system uh and then
uh to to end the factor that is really hard to control uh that it's to be aware
of the timing because the topic that is the state of the art in research is probably too early for the industrial
need or that the industry is has already worked on it but in a different way
so if you can take the industrial work or need and stretch it further
uh to the state-of-the-art you can both come predictive and get a lot of
interesting data as well so uh I call it the the golden knot to













start to collaborate on and it it probably needs some some back and forth
discussion to find this called the knot yeah thank you for your input do you
have any yep uh we have Eric
can you hear me yes yes I think it's also maybe
Maybe
the individuals I think
we as recent years
more accurately the people who are actually
to develop something that is
I think that that's complementary too you know
that's not a question of all
right uh what has struck me many times is that often when it's conceptualizes
you talk about the organization as such but you actually have talked to one individual that is probably very keen on
or interested in the the area that you're trying to solve but if you talk
to a colleague of him or in another department you will
get completely different uh responses or saying so uh to understand the different
levels of being a human or being a team or being a department or being in an
organization I think that's that's really good to take into consideration what level you're study on
a really good point Eric yep thank you Eric and Anna and maybe I
can just keep continue to discuss in this topic uh I have a
question to you oof I think the way of working in Consulting field is kind of
similar as what the researchers are doing like find the case from the industry and solve the problem for the
clients but maybe in a different way so I want to learn like
work with your clients like if there is any like a challenges when you are
collaborating together with your clients how do you overcome what kind of like uh
challenges do you have and how do you overcome it maybe we can learn from the
Consulting industry as well I happen to share some insights
I'm afraid it's not the one answer it's always different depends on
on on the company you work with but um I've been working with alone of a
different industrial Consortium that has gone together and to really
solve a problem or do something um really good and it's been different companies it's
been usually a combination of multiple companies Framing and ecosystem of some
kind and and I think the first Lessons Learned From from making making that
successful is to make sure everybody is really aligned on the vision of the goal
setting Etc that's easier said than done I mean that's probably something everybody
would sign off but it's so important in a win-win-win
scenario um companies within an ecosystem need to see their
game he can't game can't go and it just
until to spend a lot of
numbers
foreign uh yes thank thank you oh uh is there
anyone who has any comments
[Music]
foreign I would like to answer this question as
well I'm not sure if I'm in line with the other answers but I would like to talk about
um misconception or differences between uh
my gender feeling is that people in Industry can research
doesn't work and that's because there is a misalignment in understanding
what research can produce and what the industry wants
research by definition is something that's forward-looking and in Industry we try to work with
problems of today so if you want solutions for problems of today
research is often not the answer at least it's six months to a year that's
the bad minimum that you need to set so there needs to be some sort of understanding or
why do we need research in industry and this affects both the Trust In
research from industry but also the way research is conducted I would say being at the University for several
years and I know that we keep talking about uh we need to do good research but we have to make sure
that it's useful for the industry and I completely disagree with that sentence we cannot do good research but if there
is a part then it's not good research uh the the good scientific research will
always be useful to the society including Industries there is no but I I feel and this is a
problem that needs addressing from both and sports from Academia and both as
well as the industry I would say um that did not answer how can Academia
and Industry work together but that's a problem that I would like solutions to
um so we are thinking about it in our group at Scania at least and how to be better at it
yeah just wanted to mention that yeah I think that's very important perspective
the more you get used to working with each other uh then it becomes easier and
especially if you find those riches it can be most of these students it can be
Industrial phds can be [Music]
phds that are positioned different in different
organizational settings in order to to promote and to make this going
I think the those [Music] language
translator is is needed in both Academia and Industry in order to
create the produce an understanding so some kind of translators or Catholic
catalysts perhaps is needed so the the more more of those uh the
E-Series becomes to understand each other
any comments on that oh you heard me I can have a small
comment on it I think in any uh collaboration it's good to have a common view on a future State
um what is the really we like to achieve and I think this is also now our Academia can contribute a lot
things that are not here now but that are really where things are going and
and they it should be interlocked they are in our situation and and the future
state I mean it's not two different versions of the same it's it's the same thing so
I think clearly there are opportunities for strong collaboration but it's important you need to find the role
and again coming back to the win-win
just uh I think it's um to sit down and find that when we're in proposition is
is where we need to do and yeah
but also to have this policy makers and the we see a strong uh push also from
the funding agencies in order to find the interesting aspects to to discover together as a future state
I would like to add to these comments made by you both
um we talked a little bit about cases use cases on how to
um show value in research and how to present inspiration
um that's good but I also think it's for for research to actually implement it
and activate actual results in the industry there needs to be more than just use cases
there needs to be business cases and that's something that Academia could be better at in when they present their
research ideas not just a few research idea but like create
value propositions exactly like the industry 4.0 that we talk about what is the value proposition that this can
bring to the industry that could really help in pushing
results towards implementation I think Sandra yeah I I wanted to maybe Bridge all of
the things together like we talk about the future and also maybe the
opportunities for what maybe digitization can do and sometimes when when we build the systems I think that's
the main issue like we talk about like all the possible opportunities but we don't talk about
what are the actual tasks that we want to be digitized
what are the activities like which behaviors are we supporting
and sometimes it's difficult when you for a pro for a company when they talk
to a technology provider and the provider says what you want we can do everything
so we get sort of Lost in the futuristic State and we don't start with like
what do we actually want I don't know if you agree you're
and if it's difficult why is it difficult to talk about what like these
are the tasks like this and this and this and not those
yeah I agree Sandra that is the better the language or
communication between academic and Industry to to explain what is needed but also to
explain what could be promised and what could be achieved
so sorry yes I think as I mentioned in the beginning
this balance between the conceptual knowledge that the Academia will will provide and the result that the industry
wanted to have having this discussion at the beginning of the approach
um I I feel that not all research needs to
be conceptual especially in manufacturing we are an applied research field so the of course there could be
conception but not everything needs to be perception so there should be more applied research
which I feel is something in Sweden
but of course conceptual results are also important to industry but we need to know what is something that we could
have conceptual results on what is something that we need actual implementation resources that that needs
to be clear I saw that
uh Rami you have any comments uh I had
the it's very well into this
topic I think it was more like follow-up on Sandra's comment regarding the
motivations uh finding the use cases and
my feeling is that there should be more push from
regulatory or from political parties on change
Force sustainability and uh and the human Centric or more
this type of aspects and I think I think there should be more I mean
there is effort but I think there should be a bit more so this is bent and so that we have more
interactions with the Western Conference of the oil with the research that is
more objective and thought uh like knowing the neighboring
technology state of the art and into more I I think just leaving things
to having just counting on the value is not enough we need more regulation this
is my opinion we need to speed up the processes because I mean many companies are still not embracing industry 4.0 and
it should be sped up should be should become faster I think
can I comment oh yes sure yeah yeah I I since I have recently changed this
position to the regional development and to work with the smart specialization I would say that the the political targets
are there and the uh the defined in in special targets as well uh regarding
digitalization regarding the Innovation System regarding the Energy Efficiency and circular economy but but I think
there uh it what you're addressing is a little bit more awareness that this is actually
there and to to engage and evolve more
people in the or more companies in in the system I think that's the ecosystem
part that those was also mentioned in that that we probably have the political
goals also from from EU directing in the regional development but how do we
create those ecosystems that operate and then get this in place uh in reality
that's uh I think my challenge the next coming years at least so if you need if
you have any ideas then and uh support to give peace please contact me
yes yeah for sure yeah and yeah I can just leave the the floor
open to the audience as well and do you have any idea about like industry
Academia collaboration or any comments about the discussion that we had
otherwise I can move on to the next topic yes okay and this is the last topic that I
have prepared for today so it's more about what are the challenges and what are the opportunities in terms of
digitalization so there are also some questions that I
have prepared and I think I can start with you so it's more about like um
yeah uh how the AstraZeneca like um capitalize on this decision-making in
digital transformation how they emphasize or how they put this like a
digital transformation as a first step maybe you already mentioned in the first time but maybe do you have any good
example how they promote this Digital Way of working yeah
I mean one of the biggest drivers for uh
yes one of the biggest drivers drivers
in this kind of data driven decision-making
for us to be able to check
it has been a driver for us to start like what what are the technologies that could help us with
being more data driven and have a
technologies that help us to structure our data and get more insights on from our data so
this is have been driving the digitalization but from from the other side as well the digitalization have
been have made made it easier for us to to drive this kind of questions as well so
I would say that it's one of the biggest drivers related within the city making













and the other part as I mentioned before it's more like seeing that we have with
different problems that could be solved to it with the with digital and we've
people who work on shop floor to give ideas or
some of the people who were working on their own applications for instance low
code or no code applications to solve some problems so it has been like this this kind of
the two-way drivers the from a management
perspective more insights on them from
from the digital and told me the problem the shop for flow problems
so yeah I hope it answers yeah yeah yeah thanks
for your answer and I can unmute myself yes
can you hear me
I think this is the challenge where and I have this hybrid concept okay yeah but I do fix it yeah so this is so yeah also
well not maybe I can ask uh Anna um can you give us any like examples that you
have done before in terms of digitalization but focused on the sustainability perspective did
you have any project very focused on digitalization
reflected
back to the flows of materials back to the flows of energy and water and how to
use digital tools to create the awareness and transparency uh so I think this uh we have some
experience especially when an Energy Efficiency where uh the programs also include a lot of uh organizational
behavior management as well as a good example uh where we need the traceability of what we consume today
starting off from probably a factory unit back uh early 2010 and then having
full energy systems that are followed up on on the weekly basis or so
um I think also if you look ahead that many companies now have committed
to the science-based Target that I mentioned in order to reduce CO2 emissions and then the whole value chain
that includes manufacturing the logistics the material materials manufacturing the Renewables used for
their products Etc so it also involves the energies I'm creating a lot of
complexity and then we also have policy making to make sure that this uh initiatives also
are economically beneficial uh in the in the new economic system that we
hopefully get as well so I think uh when when working with
process development you always have to go back to your starting point and we really uh real-time data
uh and there is uh even if we'll come a little bit far we we need to uh still uh
see where we have our key points with the health support of data in both sufficiency of social uh economic and
environmental aspects and also get support in the complex decision making
so uh I think the I mean to mention some example to to get to CO2 reduction or
Energy Efficiency or using digitalization to operate in hazardous environments Etc tracing chemicals uh or
materials uh it needs to come back to to previous discussions as well start with
the value or a purpose and uh like a clear mission to innovate people around
so uh I hope it answers your your questions taken probably other people can comment as well yeah thank you for
your answer it feels like uh the opportunity is starting from the data itself like as hasanya mentioned the
data-driven decision making it gave us a lot of opportunities in terms of our digitalization as well and you mentioned
the scientific goal I think that is also a big opportunity for everyone so that
they can have a clear goal to take account into their business as well and
do you have any comments or uh idea about this
oh yep
and can be a bit scared
yes
according to understand
a little bit more modern Spike but why we are working together I think that we need to push
everyone to reach his own data it's not even playing this is on data so we have a lot of insightful if we didn't touch
our data try to understand regarding this data we cannot ask that
the same system from a different industries that have good Dexter material data and algorithms you have
inspired from this data because they are not commonly prepared they are not the daily practice resisted so it just
comments that everyone needs to start with on their that price of having inside for instance what is governments
can go better in better performance better accessibility better for his own
needs not for the whole ecosystem if everyone is starting to do his own thoughts then the whole ecosystem will
support this movement in my opinion yep thank you for your input
um yes and I have some questions to you uh Mahesh
so maybe in when you have been working in scania's a year and maybe you have
seen some like challenges when they are introducing new digital transformation
into your business and can you give us an example of what was the challenges if
you had or how do you how did you overcome the challenges
I haven't worked awful lot in this area but I will try to paint a picture based on what I know
and there are two types of
issues here that is
I think they exist in maybe talk about legacies right um
plenty of all machines the practice of all and everything is awesome Legacy
things that we need to digitize and and there are plenty of people
working on that and on the other end is when you actually use the digitized
factories and machines into actual business using digital tools which is
the digitalization part of it and there are plenty of challenges
between them I would say um the company like Scania which is
quite big we have plenty of I.T systems and I3 tools in the factory
one of the simplest problem is interoperability between the system we
cannot depend on one system and one type of data sources for decision making the decisions are complex because it needs
to be informed from several different perspectives so then there is discrepancy in terms of
quality availability even if everything is good then there is latency between
data and so forth and then comes the other problem of the Analytics
what analytics do we need what is that that we actually require in terms of
decision once we had everything trustworthy or not so the then the
problem is cascading in different as uh it's an ongoing problem probably in
other companies as well we're trying to work on this uh because
we cannot just have one system or one platform we need to have multiple platform because uh of the complexities
in the missions and complexities and the processes it's about how do we collaborate how do we cooperate between
the different organizations internally within China how do we share data
internally that also plays a major role in terms of
for example the scanner is like an international company so maybe you have another system in Brazil and so on like
that tell me about it I have the thing that I'm talking about is okay
okay yeah do you have any comments from online
okay I don't see any comments so then I can move on to the question to you
Sandra so you have been working in human-centric design principles and I
would like to know or if you can give any advice to us in terms of
digitalization how can we be more focused on human-centric principles and
how can we bring the human-centric principle into the digitalization because I feel like many times we are we
are like we miss the human-centric perspective just maybe technological development first yeah maybe you can
give us some insight or advice to us yes
yes and it can mean many things like safety ergonomics cognitive issues like
how we work together in the organization or teams so on
uh and and that's the topic on on its own but I think the best advice is
that it concerns the human mind right so what we really need to do is to
listen to one another use the system
and Anna talked about it previously like what is the real problem
and I would really like to stress that what is the task that we want to
digitalize or first of course digitize but is it peaking is it sorting is it
optimization is it complex problem solve solving is it alerting someone or is it
all of them together solution will be completely different like was what is it what is it not
um and I would also like to add the point of Industry 5.0

















concerns to me not only the humans in the production but Society
and that's really difficult like how can manufacturing companies also provide benefit for the society in
general and I was sad um interested in what shot GPT would say
about how society would benefit from the introduction of Cobalts
and I was disappointed by the answer I was saying because he it was in a most like
industry 4.0 like approach like increasing efficiency and
we can move production to a place where where is less cost
um and yeah I was disappointed maybe we have to solve that together like how can
we actually make some things that are better for society I mean jobs will
probably be better many people can learn or train in a better way we will make so
many Transformations I think that we're not really aware of so many things in one answer
that's okay no it is totally okay um I I feel like yeah I also do a lot of
like a courage to church if you did before I prepare something but yeah that
sometimes it it gives us like a very like a creative and like organized
answer but sometimes it disappointed us but maybe because of the information the
church Beauty had is also from the huge human generated so it's not like a Ford
question uh the answers so we that's the thing maybe the human need to be human
need to be involved and soul and really like yeah just just one question you
mentioned about when we are designing or when we are digitalizing something we need to think about uh the human first
and I was thinking about uh what if they don't want to digitalize or what if they
don't they just want to stay as it is how how do you approach them or are you
trying to show do you try to show like some examples or the Visions or how do
you convince them yeah yeah like something that comes up and in
the coaching situation we have to win that person over because that person has a lot of negative influence but also
that person can be the ambassador of the digitalization like moving forward
but uh one example that we or uh something that you can do is when you
talk about digitalization or technology you think that it's so much ahead but you can get two people that normally
don't like talk together or there are different generous generations for
instance about how they use their phone like like what what apps are you using
and how
one thing attacking what is his or her problems really
yeah I just remember when the smartphone was first introduced my parents they don't want it to use because they don't
know what can they do but nowadays they are addicted in the smartphone so it is this better to show them like how can
improve their lives but then maybe that's really important for everyone
so I hope you can still hear us because I think there is some connection delayed
here and yeah do you have any comments or the questions to
us maybe just a question from myself
oh yeah we can hear you yeah you can say something
it works that's great yeah it is working
hopefully oh you're here yes okay
uh no I I was just going to ask you uh Sandra about the like in which
which Forum will you start with like working on on the
digital culture or on like people start to change and understand what the
opportunity that is is it like in the project
work with everyone get everyone in the let's talk about a big company like
AstraZeneca would you start with having everyone in place and talking about what opportunities or like how would you
approach that
also needs to have an area work so it can have in various ways and it
should
thank you yep thank you very much uh I have a the
one last question to you oof um
yeah I I think it's that's the general question like how maybe you can share your experience uh
from the Wipro cases like how do you help the clients to overcome these
challenges and opportunities in general in terms of digitalization
like what was the how do you like make it happen in successful way maybe you
can give us some other perspective from your your experience
[Music]
adjust
ing where the wall so
right
Action Line
change that is
reason this is a typical change of the companies are doing and we need to ask
the service provider we need to help them achieve that and the third is of course
to help to modernize themselves in the
actual plans and I think this is maybe the most relevant topic for this meeting
the workshop and to me it's really it's to to build help trying to build
this Delta glue between the traditional I.T and ot to really get these things
together and get the value out of it for the people for the planets and for the
owners Etc um so building up Concepts and way of
working is something we are trying to constantly change and improve for
example working going from waterfall to an ideal we are working which is really
the core you can't you can't do everything you want to go you need to think big
Sports small but then scale fast in order to really make this
transformation going um I know that this is a very broad
number of topics that I just said but this is the reality we are in and which
we are trying to work from within to help our customers
all of them I don't know if that makes sense to you but uh it's it's not the one it's not
the simple answer therefore I kept it a bit higher level but I'm afraid
no I think the you you you touch the like a really important point I think for for everyone here as well and I just
want to open the floor to everyone if you're a bunny like a comment or the questions
okay then I think it's time to wrap up our Workshop today we already have been
using most of the time so yeah so we have been talking about the
current status and the future Trends and we pointed out the industry and the
Academia collaboration and finally at the end we talked about what was the challenges and what could be the the
opportunities in digitalization and I think today personally I feel like we
have very different input from the different fields and when it comes to collaboration I think it feels like yeah
we need our like specific roles and we we are working on that so that will be
very important for everyone so maybe before I close this session I would like
to first of all I would like to thank you for everyone especially for the panel for today and maybe do you have
any comments for today's Workshop each panel maybe I can just start from Mahesh and asanyan and go to the
Zoom
yes I will leave it a couple of open
openly I really enjoyed discussing with all the other candidates really good inputs from everyone
the question that I'd like to get answers from not immediately but eventually
when you presenter I think you had a really nice picture of this reference
architecture and then and then I saw in one of the graphs that you had
social social sustainability only one part of the access and financial
sustainability on the other I would like to know how could this be aligned so
that we don't have to choose between doing sustainable things and being more financially sustainable it's not like an
axis maybe no yeah yes unfortunately
yes and the other thing is I really I trust
I tried and the main thing that they discussed in the EU website is that it's a way you strategize your business being
more value driven or being more human-centric which is good and nice
Definitely but how do we uh convinced the job Management in doing
this moving away from the traditional business oriented to more
people-oriented especially people within the factories oriented I
don't know it's good I I buy real argument but it's it needs to be
motivated in more than just just saying you need to be more human-centric you need to have
a value proposition I think maybe uh if this work continues in the future maybe
you'll have answers to these questions yeah that's our homework for after this Workshop
but otherwise thoroughly enjoyed today thank you for everyone attending and the
other panelists as well for great discussion yeah thank you very much I can just agree that it's a very it has
been great discussions and great to hear like your opinions and uh quite happy to
see that we we don't have the we're not the only ones that have these challenges
that everyone have are having the same challenges as well and I think as we say it's it's a
challenge to maybe convince the the management teams to be able to to like approach the uh
from a human centered design even if we we can we ourselves we can get the
results from from it the like if when we when you implement a
industry 4.0 technology you will see the result directly but when you come to the
5.0 you would see it
so it's a challenge definitely I think that we will need to collaborate on on
creating this as well or showing this value to the management and I really hope to
get more insights and information from from the Academia and the other companies as well
too how could we solve our problems together so I think this could be a great start
or maybe Milestone yeah it's a good journey yeah
thank you very much and I also like to hear something from
online as well uh Sandra do you have any final comments
uh like the other side I'm very happy to have been part of this discussion it's
sometimes when you have projects you forget like you just run ahead and you don't really talk about your experience
like we have done today uh which is really really important and value-adding
so really thank you so much for all the different types of input I think what I
















bring with me are many things but I like the the thing that Mahesh said like not
thinking about the social and economic stuff separate and also thinking about
how to sort of mix the future more conceptual state with like
the the current state like how can we sort of understand moving from one thing
to the other because that seems to be very difficult thank you yeah I totally agree with that
thank you very much uh wolf do you have any final comments
first of all thanks a lot for arranging this workshop and this discussion it's
been super interesting to hear a lot so wise people's experience so thanks a lot
for that um I my reflection is um um we have a long way to go
there's a lot of hard work here to make this transition happen but um with the
likes of um of you guys and everybody on this panel I'm sure it will be possible
to do so thanks a lot again yep thank you very much
and Anna yes I would like to agree thank you very much for inviting me to this panel and
and sharing the and put them insights from all of you especially from you at the Katie and the
Rochelle with the literature review and those sorry that you conducted that frame today very well I think also that
we we are standing in a point of time where we have a lot of challenges so I'm
really looking forward to have contact for you afterwards and I can also recommend to to look into the inner
development goals we talk about how to convince managers and the Business
Leaders and I think also be complementary to the agenda 2030
sdgs the inner development goals this is probably something that we can investigate together uh with the
industry open there as well so maybe there's a spread to to follow up
yeah definitely so thank you everyone and I here as you can see here uh I
prepared some uh survey about this Workshop so if you can just like uh go
to the QR code and check submit your like opinion about this workshop and as
many people mentioned maybe this is just like a start or the journey that we are aiming to develop for further so it will
be the start and then I hope we can have some more rooms for discussion discuss
about these things in the future so thank you everyone and thank you from online as well and hope you enjoy the
rest of the day and before we wrap up all the session I would like to take a picture for everyone so if you don't
mind you can come to this uh the floor and if you don't mind an online I will
put you in the screen so that we can take a picture together
thank you everyone wait a second please so I can put the slide like this
and then yes we have
panels everyone together that's the biggest you could make
as big as you know okay this is maybe maximum okay so please come closer yeah
please come to here yeah
clothes
okay
which is
okay thank you very much
yes perfect thank you very much
yep thank you very much everyone I will close this session for now
thank you bye-bye yep bye-bye bye-bye have a nice day
fine
thank you okay
thank you
um
