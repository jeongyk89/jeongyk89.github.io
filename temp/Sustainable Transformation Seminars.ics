SUMMARY:Sustainable Transformation Seminars: Four futures - One choice
DESCRIPTION:Four Futures\, One Choice\, a new\, plain-language e-book written by experts from the Centre for Digital Built Britain in Cambridge\, presents four future scenarios for what the construction and infrastructure sector of 2040 could look like\, depending on the choices we make today. It provides a future lens enabling us to view\, with clarity and detail\, four scenarios of what Britain could look like in 2040\, depending upon the decisions that are made now\, in these unprecedented times. While we can't guarantee with any certainty the outcomes our decisions will have\, exploring future scenarios helps us identify the direction we would prefer and ultimately which way we should steer. The book sets out suggested actions that experts have suggested would result in a fairer\, greener future for all. The lead author Dr Didem Gurdur Broo and Kirsten Lamb will present the idea behind the project\, the importance of acquiring future perspective and the four scenarios of the 2040.
